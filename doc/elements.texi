Elements are low-level stateless objects composed in a tree to build valid (X)HTML. For each element class there is a corresponding HTML tag.
This means you will never have to worry about writing valid HTML yourself, but instead use the element API to build HTML in Smalltalk.

@code{#contents} methods of widgets or @dfn{controller methods} of applications are called by Iliad to build HTML using elements.
