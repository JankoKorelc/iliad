Iliad web pages are composed of nested Widgets. Widgets are high-level, reusable graphical objects. Widgets are not only about building HTML, they also hold the state of your application and will persist through requests. @code{ILWidget} is probably the most important class of Iliad, as widgets will compose most of your user interfaces and control flow.

Widgets are created by subclassing @code{ILWidget}.
